Trying to build a clone of Reddit as descibed in this tutorial.

[Code a Reddit Clone with React and Firebase](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/code-a-reddit-clone-with-react-and-firebase/)

This is just to relearn web programming along with the latest tools and frameworks used for it.

## Dependencies

### Next.js

Use npx to create a Next.js app. I don't recall installing this separately, so this must have been installed when I installed Node.js

```bash
npx reddit-clone@latest --typescript <foler_name>```dotnetcli
```

cd (change directory) into the folder just created for the app and execute the following command

```bash
npm run dev
```
